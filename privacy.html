    <h2>5. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)</h2>
    <p>Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we process your data on the following legal bases:</p>

    <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data to any third party. Data shared with the services above is strictly limited to what is necessary for their stated purpose.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>Your data is primarily stored on Supabase servers located in the European Union (Frankfurt, Germany).</p>
    <p><strong>Active Accounts:</strong> We retain your data for as long as your account is active.</p>
    <p><strong>Deactivated Accounts:</strong> If you deactivate your account (Settings > Deactivate Account), your profile is hidden from other users but your data is preserved. You can reactivate at any time by logging back in. Your username remains reserved during deactivation.</p>
    <p><strong>Deleted Accounts:</strong> If you permanently delete your account (Settings > Delete Account), we immediately delete your profile information, personal data, and authentication credentials. Mountains you created and messages you sent are preserved but anonymized (displayed as "Deleted User"). Your media files (avatar, submission content, chat media) are deleted from our storage servers. Your username becomes available for other users.</p>
    <p>We may retain anonymized, aggregated data indefinitely for analytical and improvement purposes.</p>

    <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your data is primarily stored within the European Union (Supabase, Frankfurt, Germany). Some data may be processed by US-based services (Firebase/Google for push notifications, Resend for authentication emails). These transfers are protected by Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and the EU-US Data Privacy Framework to ensure adequate data protection in compliance with GDPR.</p>

    <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Under GDPR and applicable data protection laws, you have the following rights:</p>

    <p><strong>Right to Erasure:</strong> You can permanently delete your account and all associated data through Settings > Delete Account. This action is immediate and irreversible.</p>
    <p><strong>Right to Restriction:</strong> You can deactivate your account through Settings > Deactivate Account, which restricts processing while preserving your data.</p>

    <p><strong>Right to Object:</strong> You can object to processing based on legitimate interest.</p>

    <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Climby enforces minimum age requirements based on the user's country of residence:</p>
    <p><strong>United States:</strong> 13 years old (in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, COPPA).</p>
    <p><strong>European Economic Area (EEA) and United Kingdom:</strong> 14 years old (in compliance with GDPR, Article 8).</p>
    <p><strong>All other regions:</strong> 18 years old.</p>
    <p>During account creation, users must confirm they meet the minimum age requirement for their country. The App enforces this through the onboarding process. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from a user below the applicable minimum age, we will take steps to delete that account and associated data promptly.</p>
    <p>If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has created an account on Climby without meeting the age requirement, please contact us at <a href="mailto:climbysocial@gmail.com">climbysocial@gmail.com</a> and we will delete the account.</p>

    <h2>11. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data, including: encrypted connections (TLS/SSL) for all data transmission, secure email-based authentication with one-time passcodes (no passwords stored), Row Level Security (RLS) policies on our database ensuring users can only access their own data, and secure media storage with access controls.</p>
    <p>However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>12. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
    <p>Climby is a mobile application and does not use browser cookies. We do not use advertising trackers, third-party analytics SDKs that track you across apps, or any form of cross-app or cross-site tracking.</p>

    <h2>13. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or applicable laws. We will notify you of significant changes through in-app notifications or by email. Your continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>We recommend reviewing this policy periodically.</p>
