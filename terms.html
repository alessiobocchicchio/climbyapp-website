    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="date">Last updated: February 21, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By downloading, installing, or using the Climby mobile application (the "App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). The App is operated by Alessio Bocchicchio, an individual developer based in Italy ("we," "us," or "our").</p>
    <p>If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App. We reserve the right to update these Terms at any time, and your continued use of the App constitutes acceptance of any changes.</p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>To use Climby, you must meet the minimum age requirement for your country of residence:</p>
    <p><strong>United States:</strong> 13 years old.</p>
    <p><strong>European Economic Area (EEA) and United Kingdom:</strong> 14 years old.</p>
    <p><strong>All other countries:</strong> 18 years old.</p>
    <p>By creating an account, you represent and warrant that you meet the applicable age requirement. If you are under the applicable age, you may not use the App.</p>

    <h2>3. Account Registration</h2>
    <p>To access Climby's features, you must create an account using a valid email address. You will authenticate using one-time passcodes sent to your email, so no password is required.</p>
    <p>You agree to: provide accurate and complete information during registration, maintain the security of your email account (which serves as your authentication method), not create more than one account per person, not impersonate any other person or entity, and notify us immediately if you suspect unauthorized access to your account.</p>
    <p>Your username (handle) must be unique and must not contain offensive, misleading, or inappropriate content.</p>

    <h2>4. Mountains and Content</h2>

    <h3>4.1 What Are Mountains</h3>
    <p>Mountains are user-created content aggregators. When you create a mountain, you set a title, description, category, colors, duration, submission type (photo, video, audio, or text), and optionally a featured content piece. Other users can join your mountain by submitting their own content, creating a community-driven competition.</p>

    <h3>4.2 Featured Content vs. Submissions</h3>
    <p>Featured content is a personal piece of content displayed in the mountain header. It does not compete and does not earn Aura points. Submissions are content pieces that compete within the mountain. Other users can upvote or downvote submissions, creating rankings. Submissions earn Aura points based on votes received.</p>

    <h3>4.3 Content Ownership</h3>
    <p>You retain full ownership of all content you create and upload to Climby. By posting content, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to display, distribute, and make your content available to other users within the App. This license exists solely for the purpose of operating the App and terminates when you delete your content or account.</p>

    <h3>4.4 Content Responsibility</h3>
    <p>You are solely responsible for the content you post. We do not endorse, verify, or guarantee the accuracy of any user-generated content.</p>

    <h2>5. Prohibited Content and Behavior</h2>
    <p>You agree NOT to post, upload, or share content that: contains nudity, pornography, or sexually explicit material; promotes violence, terrorism, or self-harm; contains hate speech, discrimination, or harassment based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or any other protected characteristic; infringes on intellectual property rights (copyright, trademark, etc.) of others; contains spam, misleading information, or fraudulent content; includes personal information of others without their consent; promotes illegal activities or substances; or is designed to manipulate rankings or the Aura system (vote manipulation, fake accounts, etc.).</p>
    <p>You also agree NOT to: use bots, scripts, or automated tools to interact with the App; attempt to access other users' accounts or data; reverse-engineer, decompile, or tamper with the App; circumvent any security measures or access controls; or use the App for any commercial purpose without our prior written consent.</p>

    <h2>6. Voting and Rankings</h2>
    <p>Users can upvote or downvote submissions within mountains. Votes directly affect submission rankings and the Aura points of the content creator. You agree to vote honestly and not engage in coordinated voting, vote manipulation, or any scheme designed to artificially inflate or deflate rankings.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to adjust or reset rankings and Aura points if we detect manipulation.</p>

    <h2>7. Aura Points, Badges, and Rewards</h2>
    <p>Climby features a gamification system including Aura points, levels, badges, profile frames, and achievements. These are virtual items with no monetary value. They cannot be purchased, sold, exchanged, or transferred.</p>
    <p>Aura points are earned through positive engagement (creating mountains, submitting content, receiving upvotes, completing the tutorial, etc.) and can be deducted for negative interactions (receiving downvotes). We reserve the right to modify the Aura system, point values, badges, frames, and rewards at any time.</p>

    <h2>8. Chat and Messaging</h2>
    <p>Climby provides private and group messaging features. Messages may include text, images, videos, and audio. You agree to use the chat feature responsibly and not send unsolicited, harassing, threatening, or inappropriate messages.</p>
    <p>We do not proactively monitor private messages, but we may review reported messages to enforce these Terms and our community guidelines.</p>

    <h2>9. Reporting and Moderation</h2>
    <p>Users can report mountains, submissions, or other users that violate these Terms. We review reports and may take action including: removing content, issuing warnings, temporarily suspending accounts, or permanently banning accounts.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to remove any content or suspend any account at our sole discretion if we believe it violates these Terms or poses a risk to other users.</p>

    <h2>10. Account Deactivation and Deletion</h2>

    <h3>10.1 Deactivation</h3>
    <p>You may deactivate your account at any time through Settings > Deactivate Account. Deactivation hides your profile from other users but preserves your data. You can reactivate by logging back in. Your username remains reserved.</p>

    <h3>10.2 Permanent Deletion</h3>
    <p>You may permanently delete your account through Settings > Delete Account. This action is irreversible. Upon deletion: your profile, personal data, and authentication credentials are permanently removed; your media files (avatar, submissions, chat media) are deleted from our servers; mountains you created and messages you sent are preserved in anonymized form (displayed as "Deleted User"); and your username becomes available for other users.</p>

    <h3>10.3 Termination by Us</h3>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your account if you violate these Terms, engage in prohibited behavior, or if required by law. We will notify you by email when possible.</p>

    <h2>11. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The Climby App, including its design, code, features, branding, logo, mascot, icons, and all associated intellectual property, is owned by Alessio Bocchicchio and protected by applicable intellectual property laws.</p>
    <p>You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or create derivative works based on the App or any of its components without our prior written consent.</p>
    <p>User-generated content remains the property of its creator, subject to the license granted in Section 4.3.</p>

    <h2>12. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The App is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any user-generated content.</p>

    <h2>13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Alessio Bocchicchio shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of data, loss of reputation, or loss of profits, arising from your use of the App.</p>
    <p>Our total liability for any claim arising from your use of the App shall not exceed the amount you have paid us in the 12 months preceding the claim (which, as the App is currently free, is zero).</p>

    <h2>14. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Alessio Bocchicchio from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses (including legal fees) arising from: your use of the App, content you post or upload, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any third party's rights.</p>

    <h2>15. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the Italian Republic and the European Union. Any disputes arising from these Terms or your use of the App shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Milan, Italy.</p>
    <p>If you are a consumer residing in the EU, you retain any mandatory consumer protection rights granted by the laws of your country of residence.</p>

    <h2>16. Modifications to the Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify users of significant changes through in-app notifications or email. Your continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
    <p>If you do not agree to the changes, you should stop using the App and delete your account.</p>

    <h2>17. Severability</h2>
    <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
